# Weather dashboard challenge: Server-side API's

## Your Task

Our task was to create a webpage that accesses the openweatermap API wherein users can dynamically search for a city and weather will show up along with a 5-day forecast.

The searched city would also need to be saved to local storage so that when the page reloads, it will persists the previous searched city's data.

## Usage

This webpage can be used to check weather conditions for any city in the world. When the page loads, the user needs to enter the city name. The page will get the current weather conditions for the said city.

When the page is closed or reloads, the data persists and a list of history searches can be found on the page.

## Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
